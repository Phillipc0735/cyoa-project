#### You decided to pack your bags the night before, and ended up falling asleep late and waking up late, but because you packed the night before you are still able to make your flight on time! But, you heard warnings on the news that there are storms going on and they arent going to stop for another 5 hours. Do you risk getting on the plane and flying through it? Do you wait for the next flight? Or do you just go home and wait for another day?
